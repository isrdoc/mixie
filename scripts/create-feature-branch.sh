This pull request sets up the initial development environment for the **$BRANCH_NAME** feature.

### 🎯 What's Included:
- ✅ Feature branch created from \`dev\`
- ✅ Initial commit to trigger Supabase branch creation
- ✅ Ready for feature development

### 🔄 Automatic Setup:
- 🗄️ **Supabase**: Branch-specific database environment
- 🚀 **Deployments**: Automatic preview deployments
- 🧪 **Testing**: Isolated testing environment

### 📋 Next Steps:
1. Supabase will automatically create a branch-specific project
2. Environment variables will be configured
3. Start developing the feature
4. Push commits to see automatic deployments
