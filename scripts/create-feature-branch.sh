This pull request sets up the initial development environment for the **$BRANCH_NAME** feature.

### üéØ What's Included:
- ‚úÖ Feature branch created from \`dev\`
- ‚úÖ Initial commit to trigger Supabase branch creation
- ‚úÖ Ready for feature development

### üîÑ Automatic Setup:
- üóÑÔ∏è **Supabase**: Branch-specific database environment
- üöÄ **Deployments**: Automatic preview deployments
- üß™ **Testing**: Isolated testing environment

### üìã Next Steps:
1. Supabase will automatically create a branch-specific project
2. Environment variables will be configured
3. Start developing the feature
4. Push commits to see automatic deployments
